# Google Keep Adaptation

A simple note-taking application inspired by Google Keep, initially developed as a CRUD app with PHP and MVC structure. This project allows users to add, edit, and delete notes, with a clean, minimalist interface.

## Project Background

This app was created in June 2022 as part of my early work exploring MVC patterns in web development. It was a straightforward project that helped me gain experience with CRUD operations and application structure. Since then, Iâ€™ve decided to migrate the app from PHP to JavaScript, with Local Storage handling data persistence for improved performance and easier deployment.

## Purpose of Migration

Removing PHP and database dependencies allows the app to run locally in the user's browser, simplifying the deployment process. Switching to JavaScript and Local Storage provides faster load times and makes the app more lightweight and accessible.

## Key Features

- **Add Notes**: Easily create notes with customizable content.
- **Edit Notes**: Update existing notes with new information.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes as needed.
- **Local Storage**: Notes are saved directly in the browser for a seamless local experience.

## Design Note

Although I no longer use Bootstrap in my day-to-day projects, I utilized Bootstrap in this project to make it "simpler" and faster to develop.

## Future Enhancements

As I've already finished refactoring the app, I don't plan to add any more functionality. My goal was to publish a more minimalistic version of it.
