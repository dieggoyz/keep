    a minimalist note-taking app inspired by Google Keep.
  </p>
</div>

**google keep clone** is a lightweight application for creating, editing, and managing notes, refactored from a PHP-based CRUD app to a fully JavaScript-driven app using local storage.

### features

- add, edit, and delete notes with ease.
- local storage for seamless in-browser data persistence.
- clean and minimalist UI for distraction-free note-taking.

### roadmap

- [no future enhancements planned; app is complete.]

### getting started

clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser. no dependencies or installation are required, as the app runs entirely in the browser.

### design notes

Bootstrap was used for quick UI development, although I currently favor more modern CSS solutions in my projects.

### license

this project is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).  
it's an experimental and non-commercial project meant for learning and fun.

### thanks to
